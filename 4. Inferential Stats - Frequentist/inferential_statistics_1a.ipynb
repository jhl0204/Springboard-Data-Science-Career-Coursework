    "Here we have calculated the actual standard deviation of a small (size 5) data set. But in this case, this small data set is actually a sample from our larger (infinite) population. In this case, the population is infinite because we could keep drawing our normal random variates until our computers die. __In general, the sample mean we calculate will not be equal to the population mean (as we saw above)__. A consequence of this is that the sum of squares of the deviations from the _population_ mean will be bigger than the sum of squares of the deviations from the _sample_ mean. In other words, the sum of squares of the deviations from the _sample_ mean is too small to give an unbiased estimate of the _population_ variance. An example of this effect is given [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction#Source_of_bias). Scaling our estimate of the variance by the factor $n/(n-1)$ gives an unbiased estimator of the population variance. This factor is known as [Bessel's correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction). The consequence of this is that the $n$ in the denominator is replaced by $n-1$.\n",

This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, __for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places__.
